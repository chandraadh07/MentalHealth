Reconnect Android App

Created By: Ava Bartolome, Aidan David and Chandra Adhikari


This project is an android application which recommends YouTube videos to a user based on their hobbies and emotional needs. 
"Reconnect", as we have named it, asks for a user's hobbies, current mood, and then asks them to fill out a questionnaire.
This questionnaire determines which emotions, provided by a personal relationship, the user is missing. With any of these three
pieces of information, the app selects the ten most relevant videos from a SQLite database of 2,000. The user may watch these videos
and revisit them.

Our app gives the primary user base of YouTube (15-25 year olds) a way to quickly find YouTube content while helping them cope with the
loneliness, boredom, and stress caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic.
